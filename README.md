# Postman to JEST (previously jestpagenerator)
Hello, ðŸ‘‹  
**Postman to JEST** is a command-line tool that generates Jest page object files based on data from a JSON Postman collection file.   
This tool creates separate .js or .ts files for each folder in your collection, with each folder becoming a single .js or .ts script, and each endpoint within the folders becomes an export function that can be used in your test files.

## Support Javascript & TypeScript

## Installation

To use Postman to JEST, you must install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g postmantojest
```

## Usage
To generate Jest page object files (and folders), run the following command:
```bash
postmantojest path/to/file.json
```
that will generate .js or .ts files based on your prefered language, inside **pages** folder

## Notes
- This is just a basic converter, and you may need to adjust the code if your endpoints are complex, but at least now we don't have to create the script from scratch ;) 
- Remember to create a folder called *files* in your project's root directory and put all the files inside it if your endpoints contain files, because all files will be hardcode to *./files/yourfilename.extension*
