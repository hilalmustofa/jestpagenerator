# JestPaGenerator
Hello, ðŸ‘‹  
**JestPaGenerator** is a command-line tool that generates Jest page object files based on data from a JSON Postman collection file.   
This tool creates separate .js files for each folder in your collection, with each folder becoming a single .js script, and each endpoint within the folders becomes an exported async function that can be used in your test files.

## Installation

To use JestPaGenerator, you can install it globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g jestpagenerator
```

## Usage
To generate Jest page files, run the following command:
```bash
jestconvert path/to/file.json
```
that will generate .js files inside **pages** folder, you may need to create it first.

## Notes
- This is the first release, and you may need to adjust the code if your endpoints are complex, but at least now we don't have to create the script from scratch ;) Enjoy!
- Remember to create a folder called *files* in your project's root directory if your endpoints contain files, because all files will be hardcode to *./files/yourfilename.extension*
